3dMethods

This is a collection of 3d methods implemented in cpp. There isn't really intention for any of this beyond some random exercises and reference from reading

For now this just includes:
- A Sampler of Useful Computational Tools for Applied Geometry, Computer Graphics, and Image Processing: Foundations for Computer Graphics, Vision, and Image Processing. CRC Press.
